# Task 2: Vulnerability Assessments, Penetration Tests, and APTs

**Room:** Red Team Fundamentals  
**Objective:**  
Understand the differences between vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, and the threat posed by Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs).

### 🔹 Task Summary

**Vulnerability Assessments**  
- Simplest type of security assessment.  
- Goal: identify as many vulnerabilities as possible across systems in the network.  
- Often involves automated scanning tools.  
- Security mechanisms may be relaxed to ensure full visibility.  
- Focus is on finding vulnerabilities — **not exploiting them**.  

**Penetration Tests**  
- Builds on vulnerability assessments.  
- Goal: identify vulnerabilities and test their exploitability.  
- Includes **exploitation** and limited **post-exploitation** to show real-world impact.  
- Considers how vulnerabilities chain together across the network.  
- Time-limited, so testers may be noisy and unconcerned with stealth.  

**Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)**  
- Highly skilled, organized attacker groups.  
- Often state-sponsored or backed by criminal organizations.  
- Persistent presence in networks, sometimes lasting months undetected.  
- Use advanced methods (zero-days, social engineering, stealth) beyond the scope of typical pentests.  
- Highlight the limitations of traditional security engagements.

### 🔹 Key Limitations of Pentesting Compared to Real Attacks
- **Loud:** Pentesters don’t usually care if they’re detected.  
- **Scope-limited:** Social engineering, physical attacks, and stealth bypasses are often excluded.  
- **Relaxed defenses:** Security tools may be disabled to save time.

### ✅ Questions & Answers
- **Would vulnerability assessments prepare us to detect a real attacker on our networks?**  
  ❌ **Nay**  

- **During a penetration test, are you concerned about being detected by the client?**  
  ❌ **Nay**  

- **Highly organised groups of skilled attackers are nowadays referred to as ...**  
  ✅ **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)**

### ✅ Key Takeaways
- Vulnerability Assessments = broad scanning, minimal exploitation.  
- Penetration Tests = exploitation + post-exploitation, but limited realism.  
- APTs = real-world, stealthy, persistent attackers → main driver for **Red Teaming**.
