# Task 1: Introduction

**Room:** Red Team Fundamentals  
**Objective:**  
Learn the purpose of red team engagements, their components, and how they differ from traditional penetration testing.  

---

### ðŸ”¹ Task Summary
Cybersecurity is a constant race between defenders (white hats) and adversaries (black hats). As threats evolve, organizations require specialized assessments that go beyond conventional penetration tests.  

- **Conventional Testing (Penetration Tests, Vulnerability Assessments):**  
  - Focused on finding vulnerabilities.  
  - Helps organizations take proactive steps to remediate weaknesses.  
  - May miss the realism of an ongoing adversary attack.  

- **Red Team Engagements:**  
  - Simulate real-world adversary behavior.  
  - Evaluate not only vulnerabilities, but also **response capabilities**.  
  - Highlight gaps in detection and defense.  

---

### ðŸ”¹ Room Objectives
- Learn about the basics of red team engagements.  
- Identify the main components and stakeholders involved.  
- Understand the differences between red teaming and other types of cybersecurity engagements.  

---

### ðŸ”¹ Room Prerequisites
- Familiarity with general hacking techniques is required.  
- Recommended: complete the **Jr. Penetration Tester Learning Path** before starting.  

---

### âœ… Key Takeaways
- Penetration tests show **what is vulnerable**, but red team engagements show **how an adversary would actually attack**.  
- Red teaming evaluates both technical defenses and the human/organizational response.  
- This makes red team operations a **critical tool** for preparing companies against advanced persistent threats (APTs).
